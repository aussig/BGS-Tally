A tool to track and report your Background Simulation (BGS) and Thargoid War (TW) activity in Elite Dangerous, implemented as an [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) plugin. BGS-Tally counts all the BGS / TW work you do for any faction, in any system.

Based on BGS-Tally v2.0 by tezw21: [Original tezw21 BGS-Tally-v2.0 Project](https://github.com/tezw21/BGS-Tally-v2.0)

As well as all the BGS tracking from Tez's original version, this modified version includes:

* Automatic on-foot Conflict Zone tracking (with settlement names)
* Automatic in-space Conflict Zone tracking
* TW tracking
* Logging of interactions with other CMDRs, with automatic Inara lookup for CMDR and Squadron
* Fleet Carrier materials tracking
* Fleet Carrier jump tracking
* Discord-ready information - quick Copy to Clipboard for the Discord text as well as posting directly to Discord
* An API to send data to other web applications.


# Initial Installation and Use

Full instructions for **installation and use are [here in the wiki &rarr;](https://github.com/aussig/BGS-Tally/wiki)**.


# Updating from a Previous Version

Since v3, upgrading is fully automatic. However, if you need to do a manual upgrade for some reason, **full instructions are [here in the wiki &rarr;](https://github.com/aussig/BGS-Tally/wiki/Upgrade)**.


# Discord Integration

The plugin generates Discord-ready text for copying-and-pasting manually into Discord and also supports direct posting into a Discord server or servers of your choice using webhooks. You will need to create webhook(s) on your Discord server first - **instructions for setting up webhooks within Discord are [here in the wiki &rarr;](https://github.com/aussig/BGS-Tally/wiki/Discord-Server-Setup)**.


# What is Tracked

The plugin includes both automatic and manual tracking of BGS and TW activity data.

* For a basic summary of what is tracked, see the **[Home Page of the wiki &rarr;](https://github.com/aussig/BGS-Tally/wiki#it-tracks-bgs-activity)**.
* For more detail, see the **[Activity Window section in the wiki &rarr;](https://github.com/aussig/BGS-Tally/wiki/Use#activity-window)**.


# Your Personal Activity and Privacy

If you're concerned about the privacy of your BGS activity, note that this plugin **does not send your data anywhere, unless you specifically choose to by configuring the Discord Integration or API Integration**.

## Local Files and Folders

It writes to the following locations, both in the `BGS-Tally` folder:

1. `activitydata\` - This folder contains all your BGS activity, organised in one file per tick.
2. `otherdata\` - This folder contains other data collected by BGS-Tally, including your currently active list of missions and the CMDRs you have targeted.

All of these files use the JSON format, so can be easily viewed in a text editor or JSON viewer.

(N.B. Older versions of BGS-Tally wrote to `Today Data.txt`, `Yesterday Data.txt` and `MissionLog.txt` in your `BGS-Tally` folder. If you run BGS-Tally v2.0.0 or later, these files are automatically converted to the new formats inside `activitydata\` and `otherdata\`).

## Network Connections

The plugin makes the following network connections:

1. To [EliteBGS](https://elitebgs.app/api/ebgs/v5/ticks) to grab the date and time of the lastest tick.
2. To [GitHub](https://api.github.com/repos/aussig/BGS-Tally/releases/latest) to check the version of the plugin to see whether there is a newer version available.
3. To [Inara](https://inara.cz/elite/) to anonymously check for available information on targeted CMDRs.
4. **Only if configured by you** to a specific Discord webhook on a Discord server of your choice, and only when you explicitly click the _Post to Discord_ button.
5. **Only if configured by you** to a specific web application of your choice to send your BGS / TW data for aggregation and analysis, via an API. You have control over whether you approve the initial connection, and can choose to terminate the connection at any time.
